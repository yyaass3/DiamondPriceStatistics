The file above is about statistical analyze on the diamond prices. the database used in the code is about the changes that diamond price has, affected by its carat, cut and etc.
I have analyzed the relationship between diamond objects and its price to see the effect of each variable on the price. also, the file includes many charts which helps to have a better understanding about our objects.
It obtains: bar chart, line chart, histogram, scatter plot, pie chart, etc.
Also has indicated the correlation and leaner regression between some objects which is very insightful.
The file has serios focus over probability distributions and brings clear results about this point.
At the end I have done some descriptive analyze that indicates the mean, max, min, std, skewness, kurtosis and etc of the variables.
